# We are switching to outhid because duckhid isn't being consistent on when it is and is not okay with special characters. asked
# to call from terminal and it seems to work, but asked to be called from this file, and all of a sudden it doesn't work. Rage!!

# The way the ducky drive is found is based on the label of the device. While unlikely to happen, if another drive with the same
# label exists in the computer, this will break the script and cause chaos. You may want to change the label of your ducky drive
# to something unique or specific to avoid conflicts, but that decision is entirely at your discretion. Try to avoid long labels
# and try to avoid spaces. Using quotation marks should make spaces work, but findstr is very buggy, and likes to not work well.
# The following code should not be flagging UAC, but it depends on how paranoid UAC is set to. YMMV.

# If your external drive is mounted, the batch file "DUCKY" will be called from the flash drive to give you access to some tools.
# You should be able to add to this batch file easily referring to %Drive%:\ to get to ducky.
# If your external drive does not mount automatically by Windows, you will need to use Diskpart or Disk Manager to mount it.
# Windows seems to generate a new GUID each time this device is mounted, so we cannot use any static information (other than LABEL)
# to try and mount the image with, and Linux terminal does not like complex scrips with various special characters that CMD
# uses as part of its scripting, so unless you can convince outhid and duckhid to output special characters, you may be in for
# a world of hurt if you plan to automatically locate and mount the drive using batch code.
# With that said, if you can extract enough information on where the drive may be, diskpart should be able to mount to whatever
# drive letter you want it to mount to.


# To do: If the drive is not mounted by Windows, get disk number from diskpart and mount it under CMD looping all drive letters to find the first free one.
# To do: See if these snips of code support Linux variables and move drive name to var to clean up comments.
# To do: See if Ducky USB drive has a static serial number that we might be able to use for mounting purposes.
# To do: Git Gud.
