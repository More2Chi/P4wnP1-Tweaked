# P4wnP1

I don't feel as if any of these tweaks are necessary for the official P4wnP1 project, so I created my own stub for some random
stuff I've wanted to see included.

Speaking of included:

A payload mixing duckout and hidout to call a batch file stored on the USB_STORAGE, as well as a few random tests.

A python script that will allow you to reset and power down your Raspberry Pi by putting a switch on GPIO14 and GPIO16

A tweak to the boot script that allows you to change the hostname of your Pi, so it won't come up as P4wnP1. See setup.cfg
